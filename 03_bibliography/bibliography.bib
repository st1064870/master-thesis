abstract = {We argue that the random oracle model where all parties have access to a public random oracle provides a bridge between cryptographic theory and cryptographic practice. In the paradigm we suggest, a practical protocol P is produced by first devising and proving correct a protocol PR for the random oracle model, and then replacing oracle accesses by the computation of an appropriately chosen function h. This paradigm yields protocols much more efficient than standard ones while retaining many of the advantages of provable security. We illustrate these gains for problems including encryption, signatures, and zero-knowledge proofs.},

abstract = {An encryption method is presented with the novel property that publicly revealing an encryption key does not thereby reveal the corresponding decryption key. This has two important consequences: (1) Couriers or other secure means are not needed to transmit keys, since a message can be enciphered using an encryption key publicly revealed by the intented recipient. Only he can decipher the message, since only he knows the corresponding decryption key. (2) A message can be signed using a privately held decryption key. Anyone can verify this signature using the corresponding publicly revealed encryption key. Signatures cannot be forged, and a signer cannot later deny the validity of his signature. This has obvious applications in electronic mail and electronic funds transfer systems. A message is encrypted by representing it as a number M, raising M to a publicly specified power e, and then taking the remainder when the result is divided by the publicly specified product, n, of two large secret primer numbers p and q. Decryption is similar; only a different, secret, power d is used, where e * d â¡ 1(mod (p - 1) * (q - 1)). The security of the system rests in part on the difficulty of factoring the published divisor, n.},

abstract = {We propose a fully homomorphic encryption scheme -- i.e., a scheme that allows one to evaluate circuits over encrypted data without being able to decrypt. Our solution comes in three steps. First, we provide a general result -- that, to construct an encryption scheme that permits evaluation of arbitrary circuits, it suffices to construct an encryption scheme that can evaluate (slightly augmented versions of) its own decryption circuit; we call a scheme that can evaluate its (augmented) decryption circuit bootstrappable.Next, we describe a public key encryption scheme using ideal lattices that is almost bootstrappable.Lattice-based cryptosystems typically have decryption algorithms with low circuit complexity, often dominated by an inner product computation that is in NC1. Also, ideal lattices provide both additive and multiplicative homomorphisms (modulo a public-key ideal in a polynomial ring that is represented as a lattice), as needed to evaluate general circuits.Unfortunately, our initial scheme is not quite bootstrappable -- i.e., the depth that the scheme can correctly evaluate can be logarithmic in the lattice dimension, just like the depth of the decryption circuit, but the latter is greater than the former. In the final step, we show how to modify the scheme to reduce the depth of the decryption circuit, and thereby obtain a bootstrappable encryption scheme, without reducing the depth that the scheme can evaluate. Abstractly, we accomplish this by enabling the encrypter to start the decryption process, leaving less work for the decrypter, much like the server leaves less work for the decrypter in a server-aided cryptosystem.},

abstract = {We introduce a model for provable data possession (PDP) that allows a client that has stored data at an untrusted server to verify that the server possesses the original data without retrieving it. The model generates probabilistic proofs of possession by sampling random sets of blocks from the server, which drastically reduces I/O costs. The client maintains a constant amount of metadata to verify the proof. The challenge/response protocol transmits a small, constant amount of data, which minimizes network communication. Thus, the PDP model for remote data checking supports large data sets in widely-distributed storage system.We present two provably-secure PDP schemes that are more efficient than previous solutions, even when compared with schemes that achieve weaker guarantees. In particular, the overhead at the server is low (or even constant), as opposed to linear in the size of the data. Experiments using our implementation verify the practicality of PDP and reveal that the performance of PDP is bounded by disk I/O and not by cryptographic computation.},

abstract = {In a previous paper [BS] we proved, using the elements of the theory of nilpotent groups, that some of the fundamental computational problems in matriz groups belong to NP. These problems were also shown to belong to coNP, assuming an unproven hypothesis concerning finite simple groups.The aim of this paper is to replace most of the (proven and unproven) group theory of [BS] by elementary combinatorial arguments. The result we prove is that relative to a random oracle B, the mentioned matrix group problems belong to (NPâ©coNP)B.The problems we consider are membership in and order of a matrix group given by a list of generators. These problems can be viewed as multidimensional versions of a close relative of the discrete logarithm problem. Hence NPâ©coNP might be the lowest natural complexity class they may fit in.We remark that the results remain valid for black box groups where group operations are performed by an oracle.The tools we introduce seem interesting in their own right. We define a new hierarchy of complexity classes AM(k) adjust above NP, introducing Arthur vs. Merlin games, the bounded-away version of Papdimitriou's Games against Nature. We prove that in spite of their analogy with the polynomial time hierarchy, the finite levels of this hierarchy collapse to AM=AM(2). Using a combinatorial lemma on finite groups [BE], we construct a game by which the nondeterministic player (Merlin) is able to convince the random player (Arthur) about the relation [G]=N provided Arthur trusts conclusions based on statistical evidence (such as a Slowly-Strassen type of proof of primality).One can prove that AM consists precisely of those languages which belong to NPB for almost every oracle B.Our hierarchy has an interesting, still unclarified relation to another hierarchy, obtained by removing the central ingredient from the User vs. Expert games of Goldwasser, Micali and Rackoff.},
